/**
 * Service and components to build Netty based Http web service. {@code
 * NettyHttpService} sets up the
 * necessary pipeline and manages starting, stopping, state-management of the
 * web service.
 *
 * <p>
 * In-order to handle http requests, {@code HttpHandler} must be implemented.
 * The methods in the classes
 * implemented from {@code HttpHandler} must be annotated with Jersey
 * annotations to specify http uri paths
 * and http methods. Note: Only supports the following annotations: {@link
 * javax.ws.rs.Path Path},
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.PathParam PathParam}, {@link javax.ws.rs.GET GET}, {@link
 * javax.ws.rs.PUT PUT},
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.POST POST}, {@link javax.ws.rs.DELETE DELETE}.
 * <p>
 * Note: Doesn't support getting Annotations from base class if the HttpHandler
 * implements also extends a
 * class with annotation.
 * <p>
 * Sample usage Handlers and Netty service setup:
 *
 * <pre>
 * //Setup Handlers
 *
 * {@literal @}Path("/common/v1/")
 * public class ApiHandler implements HttpHandler {
 *
 *   {@literal @}Path("widgets")
 *   {@literal @}GET
 *   public void widgetHandler(HttpRequest request, HttpResponder responder) {
 *     responder.sendJson(HttpResponseStatus.OK, "{\"key\": \"value\"}");
 *   }
 *
 *   {@literal @}Override
 *   public void init(HandlerContext context) {
 *     //Perform bootstrap operations before any of the handlers in this class gets called.
 *   }
 *
 *   {@literal @}Override
 *   public void destroy(HandlerContext context) {
 *    //Perform teardown operations the server shuts down.
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * //Set up and start the http service
 * NettyHttpService service = NettyHttpService.builder()
 *                                            .addHttpHandlers(ImmutableList.of(new Handler())
 *                                            .setPort(8989)
 *                                            .build();
 * service.start();
 *
 * // ....
 *
 * //Stop the web-service
 * service.shutdown();
 *
 * </pre>
